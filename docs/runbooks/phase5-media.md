# Runbook — Phase 5: Media Stack (ARR + Jellyfin/Plex)

Stand up the self-service media pipeline on top of the Phase-4 `/srv/nfs` tree and
the Phase-3 edge: a household member requests a title in **Seerr**, it is acquired
over **Proton VPN** (qBittorrent behind **Gluetun**, killswitch + NAT-PMP port
forwarding), imported by **Radarr/Sonarr** as a hardlink into `/srv/nfs/media`, and
played from **both Jellyfin and Plex**. On top ride a **single manual cascade
delete** (Maintainerr), a **self-maintaining** layer (Prowlarr app-sync, Configarr,
Cleanuparr, Huntarr, Byparr), and **reproducible-from-code wiring**.

> **One-line flow:** `make sync-secrets` (new keys) → deploy `arr` → run
> `stacks/arr/configure/wire.yml` (post-deploy, idempotent) → deploy `jellyfin` +
> `seerr` + `maintainerr` (P1, the MVP) → **measure Dell RAM** → deploy `plex` +
> `jellystat` + Mac `media-helpers` (P2) → prove SC-001..011 in `quickstart.md`.

## Prerequisites

- Phases 1–4 green: Docker, Komodo (Core on the Dell), Traefik + wildcard TLS,
  AdGuard, and the `/srv/nfs` tree verified (`docs/runbooks/phase4-storage.md`).
- `ssh ragnaforge-dell` (10.0.0.70) and `ssh ragnaforge-mac` (10.0.0.71) work.
- A Proton VPN plan **with port forwarding**; reuse the existing
  `WIREGUARD_PRIVATE_KEY` / `WIREGUARD_ADDRESSES` (Proton issues standard WireGuard
  configs). At least one working torrent indexer to add to Prowlarr.
- The new keys filled in the gitignored `.mise.toml` (see below) and pushed with
  `make sync-secrets`.

## Bring-up order

Follow the spec's story priorities so the RAM budget stays honest (research R7/R11).

1. **Setup** — fill `.mise.toml` (new keys), `make sync-secrets`.
2. **Foundational (`arr`)** — deploy via Komodo; wait for every container healthy and
   Gluetun's tunnel up; run `stacks/arr/configure/wire.yml`; add an indexer in
   Prowlarr; confirm native app-sync propagated it to Radarr/Sonarr.
3. **US1 (MVP)** — deploy `jellyfin` (first-run admin + libraries) and `seerr`
   (backend = Jellyfin; fulfilment = Radarr/Sonarr). Prove request→play.
4. **US2** — deploy `maintainerr`; create the manual **"remove"** collection; prove
   the six-surface delete.
5. **US3** — enable Configarr; deploy the Mac `media-helpers`; wire Byparr into
   Prowlarr and Cleanuparr/Huntarr to the arr apps.
6. **US4 (RAM-gated)** — run the **RAM headroom gate** below; if it passes, deploy
   `plex` (claim it) and `jellystat`.
7. **Polish** — reachability, reproducible-wiring proof, secret/state sanity.

Per-stack, always: `compose.yaml` → declare in `komodo/stacks.toml` → deploy via
Komodo → **wire post-deploy** (plane 3) → verify. Never wire before an app is
healthy with its API key pinned.

---

## New secrets (`.mise.toml`)

Fill these in the gitignored `.mise.toml` (placeholders in `.mise.toml.example`),
then `make sync-secrets` to push to both nodes:

| Var | How to generate | Used by |
|---|---|---|
| `RADARR_API_KEY` | `openssl rand -hex 16` | radarr, wire.yml, seerr, maintainerr, cleanuparr, huntarr |
| `SONARR_API_KEY` | `openssl rand -hex 16` | sonarr, wire.yml, … |
| `PROWLARR_API_KEY` | `openssl rand -hex 16` | prowlarr, wire.yml |
| `BAZARR_API_KEY` | `openssl rand -hex 16` | bazarr, wire.yml |
| `QBIT_WEBUI_PASSWORD` | a strong password | qBittorrent human login |
| `PLEX_CLAIM` | plex.tv/claim (short-lived, **P2 first-run only**) | plex |
| *(reused)* `WIREGUARD_PRIVATE_KEY`, `WIREGUARD_ADDRESSES` | Proton WireGuard config | gluetun → Proton |

The four servarr keys are **deterministic** — fixed at deploy time so plane-3 wiring
is fully declarative. Jellyfin/Seerr API keys are **not** stored secrets; they are
minted once by the wiring step and handed to the consumer (Maintainerr, Jellystat).

---

## Proton egress + killswitch (leak test)

`arr` routes only qBittorrent's traffic through Proton (`network_mode:
service:gluetun`). Gluetun's default killswitch means **tunnel-down = no egress**.

- **Exit IP check**: qBittorrent's observed egress IP must be the **Proton** exit IP,
  never the home IP (`76.102.108.83`).
- **Leak test (SC-002)**: stop the `gluetun` service, leave `qbittorrent` running;
  confirm zero home-line egress and stalled transfers; restart `gluetun` → auto-resume.

_Evidence: see Verification evidence → SC-002._

## Port-forward sync

Proton rotates the forwarded port; Gluetun's **native**
`VPN_PORT_FORWARDING_UP_COMMAND` POSTs the new port to qBittorrent's Web API (no cron,
no sidecar). For that POST to succeed without credentials, qBittorrent must
**bypass auth on localhost** — set on first run (see below).

- **Check (SC-002a)**: qBittorrent reports **connectable** on Proton's current port;
  restart `gluetun` → the listen port re-syncs automatically within one cycle.

## qBittorrent first-run (one-time, in the volume)

LinuxServer qBittorrent seeds its config in `qbittorrent-config` on first run:

1. Read the temporary admin password from the container log
   (`docker logs qbittorrent | grep -i password`), log in at
   `https://qbittorrent.ragnaforge.xyz`, and set the password to
   `${QBIT_WEBUI_PASSWORD}`.
2. **Options → Web UI →** enable **"Bypass authentication for clients on localhost"**
   (so Gluetun's port-sync POST to `127.0.0.1:8080` works), and set the alternate Web
   UI / trusted settings as needed. Save.
3. Set the default save path to `/data/downloads/complete` and the incomplete path to
   `/data/downloads/incomplete` (the `arr` bind maps `/srv/nfs` → `/data`).

These are the only qBittorrent settings not expressible from code (they live in the
config volume, which is Dell-local and backed up).

---

## Delete drill (six surfaces)

Per `specs/006-media-stack/contracts/deletion-cascade.md`. Seed one title present on
**all six** surfaces (on disk, seeding in qBittorrent, monitored in Radarr/Sonarr,
visible in Jellyfin **and** Plex, available in Seerr), add it to Maintainerr's manual
**"remove"** collection, and verify all six clear with **zero** orphans:

1. **Disk** — path under `/srv/nfs/media` gone.
2. **qBittorrent** — torrent removed, no seed, `downloads/` data gone.
3. **Radarr/Sonarr** — unmonitored/removed (no re-grab on next search).
4. **Jellyfin** — item absent.
5. **Plex** — item absent after its next scan.
6. **Seerr** — request cleared (title re-requestable).

Re-adding the now-deleted title = no error, no change (idempotent, SC-005). Confirm
**no** age/watch/disk rules exist in Maintainerr (manual-only, SC-004).

---

## Wiring re-run (idempotent)

`stacks/arr/configure/wire.yml` (Ansible `uri`) establishes the plane-3 edges no
native tool covers (qBit→Radarr/Sonarr download client, Radarr/Sonarr→Prowlarr apps,
Bazarr→Radarr/Sonarr, Seerr→arr/Jellyfin), GET-then-POST so a re-run is a **no-op**.
Prowlarr's own app-sync then propagates indexers; Configarr owns quality profiles.

Run it **after** the arr apps are healthy with keys pinned:

```sh
cd stacks/arr/configure && mise exec -- ansible-playbook wire.yml
```

- **First run**: adds the missing edges (`changed`).
- **Second run**: reports **no changes** (SC-011 precondition).
- **Schema drift** after a major arr upgrade: the play **fails loudly** — never a
  silent unwired stack.

_Buildarr is **not** used (unmaintained, barred). No bespoke long-lived scripts._

## RAM headroom gate (before Plex — T034)

Plex is **gated** on measured headroom (plan Complexity Tracking). With P1 running
(`arr` + `jellyfin` + `seerr` + `maintainerr`), drive a **Jellyfin HW transcode**
plus an **active download**, then measure the Dell:

```sh
ssh ragnaforge-dell 'free -h; docker stats --no-stream'
```

- **GO** — comfortable free RAM under load (rule of thumb: ≥1 GB free with the
  transcode + download running): deploy `plex` + `jellystat`.
- **DEFER** — if it's tight/OOM-risky: **defer Plex to Phase 12** (Mac Mini, 32 GB)
  per the escape hatch; keep Jellyfin as the single server for now. Record the
  decision below either way.

**Decision (2026-07-20): GO.** Measured with edge + Komodo + arr + Jellyfin + Seerr
running (idle, no active transcode): **4.9 GiB available** of 7.5 GiB (used 2.6 GiB;
buff/cache 5.1 GiB reclaimable; swap unused). Plex idles ~200 MiB, ~0.5–1 GiB under
transcode → comfortable headroom. Caveat: this is an idle reading; the binding limit
for *concurrent* Plex+Jellyfin transcode is the i3-10110U iGPU, not RAM. Operator set
Plex as the **primary** server (Jellyfin = backup), so Plex proceeds now, not deferred.

## Live-state audit (2026-07-20)

Snapshot of what is actually deployed/wired, taken directly from the running fleet
(`docker ps` on both nodes + each app's API through Traefik). Backs the reconciliation
of `tasks.md` against reality; the SC scenario table below is still to be filled by
running the behavioural drills.

- **Deployed & healthy on the Dell:** `gluetun`, `qbittorrent`, `prowlarr`, `radarr`,
  `sonarr`, `bazarr`, `unpackerr`, `jellyfin`, `seerr`, `plex`, **`maintainerr`**
  (deployed 2026-07-20; HTTPS 200 via Traefik) (+ edge/infra: `traefik`, `adguard`,
  `homepage`, `wg-easy`, `cloudflare-ddns`, Komodo).
- **Deployed & healthy on the Mac:** **`byparr`** + **`cleanuparr`** (deployed
  2026-07-20). Serve on their LAN ports (`byparr` :8191 → 301, `cleanuparr` :11011 →
  200); Prowlarr reaches byparr **directly at `http://10.0.0.71:8191`** (the designed
  path). **Note:** their `*.ragnaforge.xyz` UI routes still 404 through Traefik — the
  file-provider routes aren't in the running Traefik (created before they were added);
  loading them needs a **Traefik recreate** (inline `configs:` → DestroyStack+DeployStack).
- **DESCOPED / removed 2026-07-20:** `jellystat` (unused — Plex stats → Tautulli,
  PLAN Phase 6) and `huntarr` (pinned image no longer pullable; optional hunter).
- **Wiring still pending (UI/API, post-deploy):** Maintainerr → Radarr/Sonarr/Jellyfin/
  Seerr/qBittorrent + the manual "remove" collection (edges 13–16); Byparr as a Prowlarr
  indexer proxy + tag on bot-protected indexers (edge 5); Cleanuparr → PVRs/qBittorrent
  (edge 17).
- **Acquisition wiring (live):** Prowlarr has **5 indexers** (LimeTorrents, RuTor,
  The Pirate Bay, TorrentDownload, YTS) and **native app-sync** to **2 applications**
  (Radarr, Sonarr); Radarr's download client = **qBittorrent** (via Gluetun). → T011 ✓
- **Reachability/TLS (live):** every deployed UI answers through Traefik with a valid
  cert — `qbittorrent`/`bazarr` `200`, `prowlarr`/`radarr`/`sonarr`/`jellyfin` `302`
  (Forms/login), `seerr` `307`, `plex` `401` (all up). → T012 ✓ (backbone), T017 ✓
  (jellyfin/seerr). **Note:** SC-010 is *not* a full pass — maintainerr/jellystat/
  helpers UIs are absent, so "100% of UIs" is unmet until they deploy.
- **Quality from code:** Radarr carries a custom **"UHD + 1080p (efficient)"** profile
  (the "small 4K else 1080p" policy) → Configarr has run at least once; **custom
  formats = 0** (TRaSH CF sync not populated), so T028/SC-009 is **partial** — profile
  present, full TRaSH CF match + idempotent-rerun proof still to record.
- **Library state:** Radarr tracks **1 movie** (*The Hunger Games: Catching Fire*),
  Sonarr **0 series** → a request/grab has been exercised, but SC-001 request→play was
  not run end-to-end or recorded.
- **Secret/state sanity (T043 ✓):** `git grep` shows only `${VAR}`/`lookup('env')`
  references (no committed secret values); `/srv/nfs` holds only
  `downloads`/`media`/`photos` (no app config); the Mac holds no persistent media state.
